### Project Description
The project is a Mood-Based Productivity and Wellness Web Application that analyzes a user’s emotional state based on their input and provides personalized productivity plans, motivational tips, mood-based music recommendations, and a built-in Pomodoro timer to improve focus and well-being.

### The Problem statement
In today’s academic and professional environments, productivity is significantly influenced by an individual’s emotional state. Stress, low motivation, and mental fatigue often reduce focus and efficiency, while most existing productivity tools fail to consider the user’s mood.

### The Solution
The project aims to develop a Mood‑Based Productivity Booster that analyzes the user’s emotional state and provides personalized recommendations, motivational support, and a Pomodoro timer to enhance focus, productivity, and overall well‑being through an interactive and user‑friendly interface.

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**
![architecture](images/architecture.jpeg)
*This diagram shows how your Mood-Based Productivity App works step by step. First, the user opens the website and enters how they feel (for example, “I feel tired”). When the user clicks the “Analyze Mood” button, the frontend (React) sends this text to the Flask backend using a POST request to the /analyze API. The backend then processes the text, detects the mood (such as stressed, low energy, or motivated), and selects appropriate responses like a music link, a productivity plan, and a motivational tip. It sends this data back to the frontend in JSON format. The frontend then displays the detected mood, plan, tip, and music option to the user. If the user clicks “Start Timer,” the Pomodoro timer begins (usually 25 minutes). After the timer finishes, the session is complete.*
